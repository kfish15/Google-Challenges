## foobar
These are my Python solutions to two of the three <a href='http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/google-foobar-how-searching-web-earned-software-graduate-job-google-1517284'>Google Foobar challenges</a> I was able to complete. After (foolishly) understimating the amount of work I would have during the first week of college this semester, I missed the first challenge of level three. 


I'm intentionally leaving the title and instructions for each problem out to reduce the chance someone comes across these solutions. If you want this information or anything else, feel free to reach out to me at kodyfisher15 AT gmail DOT com .
