## foobar
These are my Python solutions to two of the three <a href='http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/google-foobar-how-searching-web-earned-software-graduate-job-google-1517284'>Google Foobar challenges</a> I was able to complete. After (foolishly) understimating the amount of work I would have during the first week of college this semester, I missed the first challenge of level three.
